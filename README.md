## Turning On Laptop Without a Power Button: Step by step guide

* The first method is to boot up your laptop with an external USB bootable device.
* Another method is to press the ESC key on your keyboard while powering up your computer. It will allow you to get into BIOS settings and configure it to work without a power button. You can then save this setting so that the next time you turn off or restart the machine, it will not ask for any input from the power buttons again.
* Another method is to use an external keyboard. There are some keyboards available in the market which provide an on-off switch at the back of it. If you have one, attach it to your laptop and use that power button for a successful boot-up of your machine without using any other input device.
* If you have window 10, then you can Enable Wake-On LAN. When you use Enable wake -on-LAN, it will turn the machine by sending a special packet to its network interface. The main advantage of using this feature is that you do not need any other device to boot up your laptop or PC and nor do you require connecting an external keyboard with it.
* Reboot your machine, and this time Enable Legacy Boot Mode in BIOS settings. Save these changes and exit BIOS. Your system should start without any problems even if there is no power button pressed on the laptop!
